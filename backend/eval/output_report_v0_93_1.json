      "model_answer": "When choosing chunk size for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, the main trade-offs are:\n\n1. **Granularity vs. Context**  \n- **Smaller chunks:** More fine-grained retrieval, which can improve relevance and precision since the system retrieves very specific pieces of information. However, smaller chunks may lack sufficient context, leading to fragmented or incomplete answers.  \n- **Larger chunks:** Provide richer context, helping the model generate more coherent and informed responses. But larger chunks can dilute relevance, as retrieved text may contain more irrelevant information.\n\n2. **Retrieval Efficiency**  \n- Smaller chunks increase the number of documents in the index, potentially slowing down retrieval and increasing storage costs.  \n- Larger chunks reduce the number of documents, improving retrieval speed but possibly at the cost of precision.\n\n3. **Embedding Quality**  \n- Embeddings of smaller chunks tend to be more focused and distinct, improving retrieval accuracy.  \n- Larger chunks produce embeddings that mix multiple topics, which can reduce embedding quality and retrieval specificity.\n\n4. **Answer Generation Quality**  \n- If chunks are too small, the generator might struggle to synthesize information across multiple chunks.  \n- If chunks are too large, the generator might be overwhelmed by irrelevant details.\n\n**Summary:**  \nChoose chunk size to balance sufficient context for meaningful answers with retrieval precision and efficiency. Typical chunk sizes range from a few sentences to a few paragraphs, but the optimal size depends on your data and use case. Experimentation is often necessary.",

It typically contains accurately labeled, clean, and representative data.\n\n**Why it’s important:**\n- Ensures model training on trustworthy data, improving accuracy.\n- Provides a standard for evaluating and comparing model performance.\n- Helps identify errors or biases in other datasets.\n- Supports reproducibility and consistency in experiments.\n\nIn short, a golden dataset acts as a “ground truth” to guide and validate machine learning efforts.",

      "model_answer": "Looking at just a single accuracy number is not enough because accuracy alone doesn’t capture the full picture of an AI teaching system’s performance. For example:\n\n- It ignores how well the system handles different types of errors (false positives vs. false negatives).\n- It doesn’t show how the system performs across diverse student groups or content areas.\n- It overlooks other important factors like engagement, adaptability, or the quality of feedback.\n- Accuracy can be misleading if the data is imbalanced (e.g., many easy questions skew results).\n\nA comprehensive evaluation should include multiple metrics and qualitative insights to understand effectiveness and impact fully.",

      "model_answer": "An evaluation pipeline helps detect regressions by systematically measuring the performance of your prompts, models, or system changes against a consistent set of metrics and test data. When you update any component, you run the pipeline to compare new results with previous baselines. If performance drops on key metrics or specific test cases, the pipeline flags these regressions, enabling you to identify which changes negatively impacted the system and address them before deployment. This ensures continuous quality and prevents unintended degradations.",
