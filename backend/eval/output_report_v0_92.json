RAG leverages retrieval to focus generation on relevant context, reducing the need for extensive retraining.\n\n4. **Flexibility:** RAG can adapt to multiple domains by swapping or updating the retrieval database, whereas fine-tuning requires separate training for each domain.\n\nIn short, RAG combines retrieval with generation to handle large, evolving knowledge efficiently without costly fine-tuning.",

It turns quality from a feeling into a measurable signal.",
      "model_answer": "An evaluation system is necessary for an AI teaching product like MentorFlow because:\n\n1. **Scalability:** Manual testing is time-consuming and cannot efficiently handle the large volume of interactions and content updates typical in AI-driven education.\n\n2. **Consistency:** Automated evaluation ensures consistent measurement of performance and learning outcomes, reducing human bias and variability.\n\n3. **Continuous Improvement:** An evaluation system provides ongoing feedback on the AI’s effectiveness, enabling iterative refinement and adaptation to learners’ needs.\n\n4. **Objective Metrics:** It offers quantitative data to assess accuracy, engagement, and learning gains, which manual testing alone may not capture reliably.\n\nIn short, an evaluation system complements manual testing by providing scalable, consistent, and data-driven insights essential for maintaining and improving AI teaching quality.",

It is typically created by experts through manual annotation or verification to ensure correctness.\n\n**How it is used in evaluation:**\n- Acts as a benchmark to compare model outputs against.\n- Helps measure performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n- Ensures consistent and objective assessment of different models or versions.\n- Identifies errors and areas for improvement by highlighting discrepancies between predictions and the golden data.\n\nIn summary, a golden dataset provides a trusted reference to validate and quantify the quality of a model’s predictions.",

      "model_answer": "Looking at just a single accuracy number is not enough because it oversimplifies the system’s performance. Accuracy alone doesn’t reveal how well the AI handles different types of errors, the balance between precision and recall, or how it performs across diverse student groups and learning contexts. It also ignores factors like engagement, adaptability, and the quality of feedback, which are crucial for effective teaching. A comprehensive evaluation requires multiple metrics and qualitative insights to fully understand the system’s strengths and weaknesses.",

      "model_answer": "An evaluation pipeline systematically tests your prompts, models, or system changes against a consistent set of metrics and test cases. This helps detect regressions by:\n\n1. **Providing a baseline:** It compares current performance to previous results, highlighting any drops in accuracy, relevance, or other key metrics.\n2. **Automating tests:** It runs evaluations automatically whenever changes are made, ensuring regressions are caught early.\n3. **Ensuring consistency:** By using the same datasets and metrics, it isolates the impact of changes rather than noise from varying test conditions.\n4. **Tracking trends:** It helps monitor performance over time, making it easier to spot gradual degradations.\n\nIn short, an evaluation pipeline acts as a reliable checkpoint to verify that updates improve or at least maintain system quality without unintended negative effects.",
