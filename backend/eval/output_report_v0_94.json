But they may include irrelevant information, reducing retrieval precision.\n\n2. **Retrieval Efficiency**  \n   - Smaller chunks increase the number of documents in the index, potentially slowing down retrieval and increasing storage costs.  \n   - Larger chunks reduce the number of documents, improving retrieval speed but possibly at the cost of relevance.\n\n3. **Model Input Length Constraints**  \n   - Larger chunks risk exceeding the model’s input length limits when combined with the query, forcing truncation or loss of information.  \n   - Smaller chunks fit more easily within input limits, allowing multiple chunks to be combined if needed.\n\n4. **Noise vs. Signal**  \n   - Larger chunks may introduce noise by including unrelated content, confusing the model.  \n   - Smaller chunks focus on specific facts, reducing noise but risking missing broader context.\n\nIn summary, choosing chunk size involves balancing context richness and retrieval precision, while considering system efficiency and model input constraints.
