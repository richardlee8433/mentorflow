      "model_answer": "A **golden dataset** is a carefully curated, high-quality set of data that serves as a reliable reference or benchmark for training, testing, or validating models and systems. It is typically well-labeled, accurate, and representative of the problem domain.\n\n**Why it’s important:**\n- **Ensures accuracy:** Provides a trustworthy standard to measure model performance.\n- **Improves training:** Helps models learn from clean, correct examples.\n- **Facilitates evaluation:** Enables consistent comparison across different models or algorithms.\n- **Supports debugging:** Helps identify errors or biases in data or models.\n\nIn short, a golden dataset is crucial for building and validating robust, reliable AI or data-driven systems.",

It ignores factors like:\n\n- **Context of errors:** Some mistakes may be more critical than others.\n- **Class imbalance:** High accuracy can be misleading if some classes dominate.\n- **Student engagement and learning outcomes:** Accuracy doesn’t measure how well students actually learn or stay motivated.\n- **Adaptability and feedback quality:** The system’s ability to personalize teaching and provide meaningful feedback isn’t reflected in accuracy.\n- **Robustness:** How well the system performs across diverse learners and scenarios.\n\nA comprehensive evaluation should include multiple metrics and qualitative assessments to understand effectiveness fully.",

      "model_answer": "An evaluation pipeline helps detect regressions by providing a consistent, automated way to measure the performance of your prompts, models, or system designs over time. When you make changes, you run the pipeline to compare new results against previous benchmarks. This highlights any drops in key metrics or unexpected behavior, enabling you to quickly identify if a change caused a regression. By standardizing evaluation, it ensures that comparisons are fair and reproducible, making it easier to maintain or improve system quality as you iterate.",
